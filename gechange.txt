---Version 1.4 Released Jul 17th, 2002---
-------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.4:
----------------
Change: Color inversion of uncolored sections is now on fixed lines.

Change: Added a blockmove command. Use negative distance to move upward.
        Any links pointing to the moving lines are not changed and will
        be wrong until manually changed.

Change: Minor addition to columnedit, replace command now shows how many
        values were changed.

Change: Added a command to dump all sections to stdout. Try 'gedit >dump.txt',
        then type in the filename, wait a few seconds for loading, then press 
        Alt-P, wait a while for dumping, then press ESC, and load dump.txt
        in your favorite texteditor.

---Version 1.3 Released May 20th, 2002---
-------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3:
----------------
Change: You can now edit when Japanese get the kill modifier.

Fix: Minor interface glitch fixed. (Using Alt-S after certain commands
     caused automatic name entry, but you could just do it again with
     no problem then.)

Change: You can now swap any two lines in a section. This may have drastic
        effects depending on the degree of hardwiredness, so take care.
        Also, any related sections are not affected, any links still
        point to the same line while that lines contents have changed.
        (Mainly of use if you wish to alphabetize your ships :)

Change: Added a clock to the main screen, also minor changes to the layout.

Fix: Wrong values in the British generals section of pwgedit.def.

Fix: You can now do a descending range properly.

Change: Removed the gepacexe.def from the distribution, due to potential
        for misbehavior. Any comments in this changes file relating to the
        editing of the pac.exe no longer apply!

Change: Updated the gedit.def file for PacWar 3.0.

Note: This will be the last version, unless I get some new ideas on what to
      implement.

-------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.2:
----------------
Change: You can now edit HQ nationalities.

Change: You can now edit the year the game ends if no points advantage.

Change: You can now edit the 'zero' year of aircraft arrival.

Change: The file being edited is now shown on main screen.

Change: You can edit both the aircraft upgrade paths, factories and groups.

Change: Minor changes to pwgedit.def.

Change: You can edit (somewhat) the days/turn. Warning! This has several
        side-effects, such as the date in relation to unit arrivals still
        being based on a 7 day turn, except planetype arrival that looks
        at the date. Taskforce movement is also based on 7 day turns. Any 
        date based events also look at the date.

Change: You can now, when editing a column, give it a range and lines
        between start and end are linearly assigned.

Change: You can now do a Find by name. Case insensitive (for full name), 
        also substring search (case sensitive). Only for those names
        found in the file being edited (not references to other sections).

Change: You can now edit whether a divided unit becomes another type.
        (See establishment section for a list. LCU splitting to edit.)
